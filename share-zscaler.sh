#
# A script to share a Zscaler tunnel.
#
# Usage:
# SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='
#     foo.bar.internal
#     example.com
# ' ./share-zscaler.sh
#
# The script sets up network address translation (NAT) so that
# all requests coming from the network of interface en0 have access
# to the network the first resolved host routes to
# (e.g. 10.100.0.0/16 using the tunnel interface utun3).
#
# The script also outputs necessary steps on how to configure
# your local host to actually pass requests to your tunnel endpoint
# for the hosts foo.bar.internal and example.com.
#
# The above example corresponds to the full call:
# SHARE_ZSCALER_TUNNEL_INTERFACE=utun3 \
# SHARE_ZSCALER_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS=10.100.0.0/16 \
# SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.64.0/24 \
# SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='
#     foo.bar.internal
#     example.com
# ' ./share-zscaler.sh
#
# Without a local copy this script can also be called using curl:
# SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='
#     foo.bar.internal
#     example.com
# ' bash -c "$(curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/main/share-zscaler.sh)"
