# A script to help sharing a Zscaler tunnel.
#
# Usage:
# SHARE_ZSCALER_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS=10.100.0.0/16 \
# SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='
#     example.com
#     foo.bar.internal
# ' sudo -E ./share-zscaler.sh
#
# This call will set up network address translation (NAT) so that
# all requests coming from network 192.168.64.0/24 will have access
# to network 10.100.0.0/16 using the tunnel interface utun3.
#
# The script will also output necessary steps on how to configure
# your local host to actually pass requests to your tunnel endpoint
# for the hosts example.com and foo.bar.internal.
#
# The above example corresponds to the full call:
# SHARE_ZSCALER_TUNNEL_INTERFACE=utun3 \
# SHARE_ZSCALER_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS=10.100.0.0/16 \
# SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.64.0/24 \
# SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='
#     example.com
#     foo.bar.internal
# ' sudo -E ./share-zscaler.sh
#
# tunnel interface utun3,
# bashsupport disable=BP5001

# Name of the interface used by Zscaler to tunnel the traffic
# Use `ifconfig` and look the the entry containing "inet 100.64.0.1 --> 100.64.0.1 netmask 0xffff0000"
