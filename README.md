# Killing Zscaler on macOS

Zscaler can be annoying if you're trying to stop it. Despite having administrative rights, usually it asks for a password.

Pick one of the following options to take back control.

## Using the App

People who prefer to use apps over command lines, can use
`Kill Zscaler.app` which is a simple wrapper of the shell script described below.

- [Download this repository as an archive](https://github.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
- Open `Kill Zscaler.app` to kill Zscaler.
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or open `Start Zscaler.app`.

## Using a Shell Script

- Open Terminal or whatever terminal you prefer (e.g. [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)).
- Type `git clone https://github.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler.git`
- Type `cd kill-zscaler` to change into the newly cloned repository.
- Make sure the scripts are executable by running `chmod +x kill-zscaler.sh start-zscaler.sh`
- Type `./kill-zscaler.sh` to kill Zscaler.
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or type `./start-zscaler.sh`.

## Using a Shell

- Open Terminal or whatever terminal you prefer (e.g. [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)).
- Type `find /Library/LaunchAgents -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;;sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;`
to kill Zscaler.
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or
  type `open -a /Applications/Zscaler/Zscaler.app --hide; sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl load {} \;`.

### Using an Alias

To kill Zscaler by typing `kill-zscaler` (and to start it with `start-zscaler`) do the following steps:

- Open the shell initialization file of your shell
  - Bash: ~/.bashrc
  - ZSH: ~/.zshrc
  - For more information aliases, read https://medium.com/@rajsek/zsh-bash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc-e30045652f2e or any other appropriate Google
    match.
- Add the contents of `kill-zscaler.alias.txt` or the following lines to it:
  ```shell
  alias start-zscaler="open -a /Applications/Zscaler/Zscaler.app --hide; sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl load {} \;"
  alias kill-zscaler="find /Library/LaunchAgents -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;;sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;"
  ```
- Open a new shell (or type `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc` / â€¦ to load your changes)
- Type `kill-zscaler` to kill Zscaler
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or type `start-zscaler`.


# Sharing Zscaler

To share an existing Zscaler VPN tunnel you can use [share-zscaler.v2.sh](share-zscaler.v2.sh) on the machine
with Zscaler installed as follows:
```shell
./share-zscaler.sh \
  --probe foo.bar.internal \
  --domain internal
```

- The script sets up network address translation (NAT) on the VPN client machine
  so that its VPN tunnel can be shared.
  - The `--prope` argument can be any hostname you want to connect to using the VPN tunnel.
    It's used to determine the connection details of your VPN connection.
  - The domains specified with one or more `--domain` arguments are used to
    customize the DNS name resolution on your host.
    This makes your host use your VPN client's name resolution for the specified domains (and sub-domains).
- It prints a configuration script that needs to be run on your host to make it use the just shared tunnel. 

If you prefer to have a one-liner without having to download anything you can use the following
command *at your own risk*:

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/main/share-zscaler.v2.sh)" -- \
  --probe foo.bar.internal \
  --domain internal
```

## Parallels macOS VM

If you only have a macOS client at hand you can set up a virtual macOS machine using [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/pd/virtual-machines-for-mac).

1. [Install Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/trial/)
2. Set up a virtual machine
   1. The following scripts sets up a macOS machine with minimal footprint:
      ```shell
      declare -r PARALLELS=/Applications/Parallels\ Desktop.app
      declare -r VMDIR=$HOME/Parallels
      declare -r NAME=Zscaler
      curl -LfSo "$VMDIR/macOS.ipsw" "$("$PARALLELS"/Contents/MacOS/prl_macvm_create --getipswurl)"
      "$PARALLELS"/Contents/MacOS/prl_macvm_create "$VMDIR/macOS.ipsw" "$VMDIR/$NAME.macvm" --disksize 40000000000
      cat <<CONFIG >"$VMDIR/$NAME.macvm/config.ini"
      [Hardware]
      vCPU.Count=1
      Memory.Size=2147483648
      Display.Width=1920
      Display.Height=1080
      Display.DPI=96
      Sound.Enabled=0
      Network.Type=1
      CONFIG
      open "$VMDIR"
      open -a "$PARALLELS" "$VMDIR/$NAME.macvm"
      ```
      Take the chance to customize the above settings to your requirements.   
      **At the time of writing, the disk size cannot be altered later.**  
      40GB disk space (see `--disksize` argument) are recommended.  
      32GB disk space are the bare minimum.  
   3. Create a macOS user
   4. Install Parallels Tools and reboot
   5. Install Zscaler
   6. Login
3. Establish connection
   1. Start Zscaler (if not already running)
   2. [Run share-zscaler.sh](#sharing-zscaler)
4. Use connection
   1. On your local machine open a terminal
   2. Paste the host configuration script (that was printed in the previous step) in the terminal and run it

**You can now connect to all hosts you listed in step 2** ðŸŽ‰

Optionally, you can set the name of your VM in
1. System Preferences â†’ Network â†’ Ethernet â†’ Advanced... â†’ WINS â†’ NetBIOS Name
2. System Preferences â†’ Sharing â†’ Computer Name

## Remote Execution

This section describes the necessary steps to run `share-zscaler.v2.sh` on your
local machine instead of the virtual Zscaler machine using SSH.

### Preparation

#### On your virtual machine
1. Activate SSH by checking System Preferences â†’ Sharing â†’ Remote Login
2. Optionally extend your sudoers so that you may run `sysctl` and `pfctl` without having to enter your password:
   ```shell
   (
   echo "$(whoami) ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/sysctl *"
   echo "$(whoami) ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/pfctl *"
   ) | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/zscaler
   ```
3. Optionally prepare a script with the following contents to lock your screen
   ```bash
   cat << 'LOCK_SCREEN' > ~/Desktop/lock-screen
   #!/bin/bash
   osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "q" using {command down,control down}'
   LOCK_SCREEN
   chmod +x ~/Desktop/lock-screen
   ```
   and run it on login via System Preferences â†’ *Choose your user* â†’ Login items â†’ + â†’ *Select your lock screen script*  
   Don't forget to make it executable using `chmod +x` and to run it once to provide it with sufficient permissions.
4. If the IP of your VPN client machine is dynamic and you can't reliably resolve its IP, a workaround can be to install [GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/) and display the output of `ipconfig getifaddr en0` in a script Geeklet. At least you now find out the current IP easily.

#### On your local machine

1. [Create an SSH key](https://www.google.com/search?q=create+ssh+key+macos) or use an existing one
2. Copy the public key of your just created key pair to your Zscaler machine:
   ```shell
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa zscaler@Zscaler.local
   ```
   *This snippet assumes that your Zscaler host has the name `Zscaler` and your user account on that machine is `zscaler`.*
3. Check if you can log in:
   ```shell
   ssh zscaler@Zscaler.local printenv
   ```
   If the output shows the environment variables of your Zscaler host, all is fine.

### Execution

The following command needs to be run on your working machine,
which then connects to the host `Zscaler` with user `zscaler`,
and finishes configuring your working machine using the returned configuration Bash script:
```shell
(
  bash <<'SHARE_ZSCALER_V2'
ssh -4t zscaler@Zscaler.local '
bash -c "$(curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/main/share-zscaler.v2.sh)" -- \
  --probe foo.bar.internal \
  --domain internal
'
SHARE_ZSCALER_V2
) | bash
```

You get prompted for the password of user `zscaler` (unless you did the optional [sudoers configuration](#on-your-virtual-machine)).

> ðŸ’¡ Users with a VPN host machine with dynamic IP can try to
change the `ssh` command to:
> ```shell
> ssh -4t "zscaler@$(sudo nmap -n -p 22 192.168.206.2-254 -oG - | awk '/Up$/{print $2}')"
> ```
> Be sure to change the `192.168.206` part to match the client's address range.
> The above `nmap` command looks for a machine with an open SSH port and pass the match to the `ssh` command. 

**Example output**:
```
No ALTQ support in kernel
ALTQ related functions disabled
pfctl: pf not enabled
No ALTQ support in kernel
ALTQ related functions disabled
rules cleared

## Troubleshooting
- You can run the setup script as many times as you like.
- The output script to run on your local machine updates your name resolution accordingly,
  that is, it updates existing hosts and adds new ones.
- You will very likely have to update `SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS` to the network used by your Parallels installation.
  - You can look it up by opening System Preferences â†’ Network â†’ Ethernet â†’ IP Address
  - As an example: if the screen shows `192.168.42.3` you'll have to use `SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.42.0/24`
- If you happen to have no access anymore
  - check if Zscaler is actually connected
  - run (1) your customized `share-zscaler.sh` call on the VM and (2) its output script on your local machine again.
