# Killing Zscaler on macOS

Zscaler can be annoying if you're trying to stop it. Despite have administrative rights, usually it asks for a password.

Pick one of the following options to take back control.

## Using the App

People who prefer apps over command lines can use
`Kill Zscaler.app` which is a simple wrapper of the shell script described below.

- [Download this repository as an archive](https://github.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
- Open `Kill Zscaler.app` to kill Zscaler.
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or open `Start Zscaler.app`.

## Using a Shell Script

- Open Terminal or whatever terminal you prefer (e.g. [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)).
- Type `git clone https://github.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler.git`
- Type `cd kill-zscaler` to change into the newly cloned repository.
- Make sure the scripts are executable by running `chmod +x kill-zscaler.sh start-zscaler.sh`
- Type `./kill-zscaler.sh` to kill Zscaler.
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or type `./start-zscaler.sh`.

## Using a Shell

- Open Terminal or whatever terminal you prefer (e.g. [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)).
- Type `find /Library/LaunchAgents -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;;sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;`
to kill Zscaler.
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or
  type `open -a /Applications/Zscaler/Zscaler.app --hide; sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl load {} \;`.

### Using an Alias

To kill Zscaler by typing `kill-zscaler` (and to start it with `start-zscaler`) do the following steps:

- Open the shell initialization file of your shell
  - Bash: ~/.bashrc
  - ZSH: ~/.zshrc
  - For more information aliases, read https://medium.com/@rajsek/zsh-bash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc-e30045652f2e or any other appropriate Google
    match.
- Add the contents of `kill-zscaler.alias.txt` or the following lines to it:
  ```shell
  alias start-zscaler="open -a /Applications/Zscaler/Zscaler.app --hide; sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl load {} \;"
  alias kill-zscaler="find /Library/LaunchAgents -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;;sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;"
  ```
- Open a new shell (or type `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc` / â€¦ to load your changes)
- Type `kill-zscaler` to kill Zscaler
- To use Zscaler again, reboot or type `start-zscaler`.


# Sharing Zscaler

To share an existing Zscaler connection you can use [share-zscaler.sh](share-zscaler.sh) on the machine
with Zscaler installed as follows:
```shell
SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.64.0/24 \
SHARE_ZSCALER_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS=10.100.0.0/16 \
SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='
    example.com
    foo.bar.internal
' ./share-zscaler.sh
```

- The script will set up network address translation (NAT) so that traffic
from 192.168.64.x will be properly routed.
- It prints instructions on how to configure clients to actually 
pass their requests to your Zscaler machine for the specified domains.
- It copies a script to your clipboard that applies all just mentioned steps.

If you prefer to have a one-liner without having to download anything you can use the following
command *at your own risk*:
```shell
SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.64.0/24 \
SHARE_ZSCALER_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS=10.100.0.0/16 \
SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='
    example.com
    foo.bar.internal
' bash -c "$(curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/main/share-zscaler.sh)"
```

## Parallels macOS VM

If you only have a macOS client at hand you can set up a virtual macOS machine using [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/pd/virtual-machines-for-mac).

1. [Install Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/trial/)
2. Set up a virtual machine
   1. The following scripts sets up a macOS machine with minimal footprint:
      ```shell
      declare -r PARALLELS=/Applications/Parallels\ Desktop.app
      declare -r VMDIR=$HOME/Parallels
      declare -r NAME=Zscaler
      curl -LfSo "$VMDIR/macOS.ipsw" "$("$PARALLELS"/Contents/MacOS/prl_macvm_create --getipswurl)"
      "$PARALLELS"/Contents/MacOS/prl_macvm_create "$VMDIR/macOS.ipsw" "$VMDIR/$NAME.macvm" --disksize 30000000000
      cat <<CONFIG >"$VMDIR/$NAME.macvm/config.ini"
      [Hardware]
      vCPU.Count=1
      Memory.Size=2147483648
      Display.Width=1920
      Display.Height=1080
      Display.DPI=96
      Sound.Enabled=0
      Network.Type=1
      CONFIG
      open "$VMDIR"
      open -a "$PARALLELS" "$VMDIR/$NAME.macvm"
      ```
   2. Create a macOS user
   3. Install Parallels Tools and reboot
   4. Install Zscaler
   5. Login
3. Establish connection
   1. Start Zscaler (if not already running)
   2. [Run share-zscaler.sh](#sharing-zscaler)
4. Use connection
   1. On your local machine open a terminal
   2. Paste the script (that was copied in the previous step to your clipboard) in the terminal and run it

**You can now connect to all hosts you listed in step 2** ðŸŽ‰

Optionally you can set the name of your VM in
1. System Preferences â†’ Network â†’ Ethernet â†’ Advanced... â†’ WINS â†’ NetBIOS Name
2. System Preferences â†’ Sharing â†’ Computer Name

## Remote Execution

This section describes the necessary steps to run `share-zscaler.sh` on your
local machine instead of the virtual Zscaler machine using SSH.

### Preparation

#### On your virtual machine
1. Activate SSH by checking System Preferences â†’ Sharing â†’ Remote Login

#### On your local machine

1. [Create an SSH key](https://www.google.com/search?q=create+ssh+key+macos) or use an existing one
2. Copy the public key of your just created key pair to your Zscaler machine:
   ```shell
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa zscaler@Zscaler.local
   ```
   *This snippet assumes that your Zscaler host has the name `Zscaler` and your user account on that machine is `zscaler`.*
3. Check if you can log in:
   ```shell
   ssh zscaler@Zscaler.local printenv
   ```
   If the output shows the environment variables of your Zscaler host, all is fine.

### Execution

The example used in this chapter will change to the following in order to be executed
on the host `Zscaler` with user `zscaler`:
```shell
ssh -t zscaler@Zscaler.local '
SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.64.0/24 \
SHARE_ZSCALER_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS=10.100.0.0/16 \
SHARE_ZSCALER_HOSTS='"'"'
    example.com
    foo.bar.internal
'"'"' bash -c "$(curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/main/share-zscaler.sh)"'
```

You will be prompted for the password of user `zscaler`.  
After you ran the command you'll have the command to be executed locally in your clipboard and can just paste it.

You can even call `pbpaste | bash` to run that script directly.


## Troubleshooting
- You can run the setup script as many times as you like.
- The output script to run on your local machine updates your name resolution accordingly,
  that is, it updates existing hosts and adds new ones.
- You will very likely have to update `SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS` to the network used by your Parallels installation.
  - You can look it up by opening System Preferences â†’ Network â†’ Ethernet â†’ IP Address
  - As an example: if the screen shows `192.168.42.3` you'll have to use `SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.42.0/24`
- If you happen to have no access anymore
  - check if Zscaler is actually connected
  - run (1) your customized `share-zscaler.sh` call on the VM and (2) its output script on your local machine again.
